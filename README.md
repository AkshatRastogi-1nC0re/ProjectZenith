# ProjectZenith

Today, software developers around the world are faced with the issue of redundancy in their work. We conducted a survey and found out that nearly 80% of
developers believe that they spend less time coding, and more doing monotonous
and redundant tasks like searching for topic on the internet, typing emails,writing
boilerplate code,browsing multiple websites etc along with a set of many superfluous tasks, that ultimately lead to the loss of interest and motivation, especially
amongst people who are relatively new to coding.

Project Zenith aims to provide software developers and students, a less redundant work environment on their personal computers,and to also motivate them to
learn computer science as a hobby and not merely as a subject.
Under Project Zenith, we have developed a smart voice assistant (”Moto”), that
is customised especially to cater to the needs of the developers. Moto will act as a
developers personal assistant and will also help them be more productive in their
day-to-day tasks.

Along with several usual features found in most of the voice assistants in the
market, our assistant has certain unique and state-of-the-art features like face
recognition, human mood recognition, face-mask-recognition, coding-helper, socialmedia automation, shopping automation, Messaging and Music Automation etc,
that make our project in competition with the other commercial products in the
market.

Some downfalls of our project include, slight increase in the latency of speech
recognition and also errors in the precision of the recognised speech.
In conclusion, Project Zenith is still in need of a few improvements and since
the project is based on open-source architecture, we expect that these issues will be
resolved soon in the future.
